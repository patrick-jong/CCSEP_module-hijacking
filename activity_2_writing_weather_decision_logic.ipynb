        "\n",
        "In this activity you will write code that uses if-else statements to provide a weather forecast based on the user's menu selection.  \n",
        "For example, if the user selects \"Check Temperature\", your program should prompt them to enter the current temperature and then use nested if-else statements to display messages such as \"It’s cold – wear a jacket\" or \"It’s warm – enjoy the day!\"  \n",
        "This exercise will help you practise writing nested if-else statements and understanding logical comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Advanced Concept:** In previous activities, we've written simple programs that execute one line after another, which is known as \"sequence\"—a fundamental building block of programming. This week, we introduce the if-else statement, which allows the program to decide which block of code to execute based on conditions. This decision-making process is called \"selection\" and is another essential concept in building dynamic and interactive programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** Remember that the input() function always returns a string. This means that even if the user types a number, it is read as a string. To perform numerical comparisons, you must convert the input to a number using int() (or float())."
